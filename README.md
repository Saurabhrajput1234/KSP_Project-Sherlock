## USP (Unique Selling Point)

During the process of anonymizing personal identifiers in a crime dataset, our tool assigns a unique identifier to each entity in a document and creates an Entity-Map. By this KSP can de-anonymize not only their own anonymized file but also the responses or reports generated by 3rd party based on that anonymized file.
